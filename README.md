full code in code.r

Fit a Gompertz generalized linear model with Poisson errors and log link.

Apply suitable statistical tests on the associated Pearson residuals to assess the suitability of the fitted model for actuarial use, including appropriate plots.

Fit a Lee-Carter model to the data from calendar year 1950.

Project the (log) force of mortality forward for 20 years by modelling future values of &#954;<sub>y</sub> as a time series (random walk with constant drift).
